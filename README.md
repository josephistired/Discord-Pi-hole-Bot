# ⚠️ Important Notice!

This project is no longer actively maintained. I no longer use Pi-hole (I've switched to NextDNS), so development has stopped for the time being. That said, you're welcome to fork the project and make your own improvements — contributions are always welcome!

# 🍾 Discord.js-Pi-hole-Bot

A simple Discord bot that uses the Pi-hole API to fetch stats and control your Pi-hole DNS server. You can check server performance or toggle blocking with easy commands — all from Discord.
