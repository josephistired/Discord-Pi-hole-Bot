<h1>Important Notice!</h1>
<p>While this bot has not been updated due to limitations in the pi-hole API. The Pi-hole team has announced the release of Pi-hole v6 is coming sooner or later with a brand new, "A new REST API and web server directly embedded into the pinhole-FTL binary". Check it out [here](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/pi-hole-v6-beta-testing/65413).</p>

<p>When v6 is released, I will see and try & implement the new features into the bot.</p>
