# ⚠️ Important Notice!

This project is no longer actively maintained. I no longer use Pi-hole (I've switched to NextDNS), so development has stopped.

> ⚠️ **This bot will not work with Pi-hole v6 or newer.**  
> The Pi-hole API was completely rewritten in v6, and this bot relies on the older API used in Pi-hole v5 and below.

You're welcome to fork the project and update it to support the new API if you'd like — contributions are always welcome!

A simple Discord bot that uses the Pi-hole API to fetch stats and control your Pi-hole DNS server. You can check server performance or toggle blocking with easy commands — all from Discord.
